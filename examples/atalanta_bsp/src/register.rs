    /// Holds an 8-bit field (th) for the threshold level of the associated
    /// privilege mode. The th field is held in the least-significant 8 bits of
    /// the CSR, and zero should be written to the upper bits.
    ///
    /// A typical usage of the interrupt-level threshold is for implementing
    /// critical sections. The current handler can temporarily raise its
    /// effective interrupt level to implement a critical section among a subset
    /// of levels, while still allowing higher interrupt levels to preempt.
    ///
    /// The current hartâ€™s effective interrupt level would then be:
    /// effective_level = max(mintstatus.mil`, mintthresh.th)
    ///
    /// The max is used to prevent a hart from dropping below its original level
    /// which would break assumptions in design, and also makes it simple for
    /// software to remove threshold without knowing its own level by simply
    /// setting mintthresh to the lowest supported mintthresh value.
    ///
    /// The interrupt-level threshold is only valid when running in associated
    /// privilege mode and not in other modes. This is because interrupts for
    /// lower privilege modes are always disabled, whereas interrupts for higher
    /// privilege modes are always enabled.
